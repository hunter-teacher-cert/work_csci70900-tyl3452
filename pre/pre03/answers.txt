Eric Liu pre03 Exercise 1

1 - 

No, I wug.
You wugga wug.
I wug.


main starts with it's print "No, I " and calls zoop. 
Zoop calls baffle which prints and then calls ping.
Ping prints a dot and ends the sentence.
Flowing back, zoop prints "You wugga " and calls baffle again which starts the same as before and ends with ping and a printed dot.



2 - 
main	No I 
zoop	
baffle	wug
ping	.
zoop	You wugga 
baffle	wug
ping	.
main	I 
baffle	wug
ping	.


3 - 
You will get an infinite loop. baffle already invokes ping so invoking baffle inside ping will continuously create a deeper and deeper cycle.
