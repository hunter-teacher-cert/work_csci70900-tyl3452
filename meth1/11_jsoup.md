Option 2: Students will analyze sports statistics (e.g. NBA, MLB).

### Assumptions: We talked to the tech guys, we're good to go.
### Set Up
* create folder for today's assignment
* download starter code and compile (.jar files) save in the folder from prev step
* make sure students typed into correct class path
* compile & run to see if functional
* move to activity--pick 1 of 2 options (or other webpage)
* See if they can display something from that webpage by modifying starter code

### Deliverables
Come up with new information through your research (new insight)
Option 1: Generate a basic bar graph (e.g. player vs points)
Option 2: Generate stats of common words/topics (average words, mode, etc) 

### Reflections

What are our new insights?
What kind of article could be written using the data you extracted?
