## Lesson objective: Effectively use control structures to repetitively create and draw different shapes

#### Standard: 9-12.CT.8

#### Prior Knowledge: Geometric angles and regular polygons (square,pentagon,octagon, etc), Logic conditional statements <>=.


### Aim: How do we use the for loop to draw a regular polygon / create some art!?

---

### Warm up
time: 3-5 mins

Write down a sequence of steps that can be repeated to draw a pinwheel. (Image of pinwheel shown). 
Physically mimic the steps you would take starting at putting a pen down to draw. Once you put your pen down, you start drawing. Be careful not to skip steps such as lifting your pen, which would cause you to stop drawing.

- Teacher circulating between small groups.

#### - CFUs/Misconceptions
Teacher Q: How long is each side? How did you draw this side without lifting your pen? What is your starting point? What is your ending point? Did you start and end at the same point? Which set of instructions repeat?

### Lesson Activity Part 1 (repetition w/o loop control structure)
time: 10 mins

Write down all the steps to draw 3, squares/houses/or 5 sided pinwheels next to each other (without overlapping). Write out all repeating steps (do not use loops at this point of time).
Choose a specific distance such as 1 inch to the right of the current pen position when moving to next pinwheel and you can default the side length to any appropraite number.

#### - CFUs/Misconceptions
Teacher Q: What part is repetitive? Is there a repetition within a repetition? Are there/Did you use any written shorthands you used so you do not have to rewrite the same thing?

- Teacher presents additional activity challenge and circulates between small groups again to CFU.

### Lesson Content
time: 10-15 mins

Teacher - Define and model / live code how to write a for loop to count up from 0 to 9. Implement and display outputs. Modify starting and end points and display changed outputs that occur.

Teacher - Take an algorithm (to draw a house or any other shape) and model how you would break it up and implement as a for loop.

Teacher - Take another algo(how to draw a square) and ask for class chare out how to break up code as a for loop.

Teacher Q: If I changed this value (starting/ending), what is the output to the screen? If I changed the condition with < or <=, what is output to the screen?

---

### Lesson Activity Part 2
time: 15 mins

Students - Take a look at their pinwheel code, adjust if necessary and they will break up and implement a for loop.


#### - CFUs/Misconceptions
Teacher Q: Where do you indicate to stop your loop? And why did you choose that location/number?

### Closing
time: 3-5 mins

Option 1 - MCQ (with code snippet images) - Which algorithm below using the for loop control structure will correctly output a 5 sided pinwheel?

Option 2(Challenge) - If complete with the question above, Write/Edit a for loop again to be able to draw an octagon/decagon.
