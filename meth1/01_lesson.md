## Lesson objective: Effectively use control structures to repetitively create and draw different shapes

#### Standard: 9-12.CT.8


### Aim: How do we use the for loop to draw a regular polygon?

---

### Warm up
time: 3-5 mins

Write down a sequence of steps that can be repeated to draw a pinwheel. (Image of pinwheel shown). 
Physically mimic the steps you would take starting at putting a pen down to draw.

---

### Lesson Activity Part 1 (repetition w/o loop control structure)
time: 10 mins

Write down all the steps to draw 3, squares/houses/or pinwheels next to each other (without overlapping). 
Choose a specific distance such as 1 inch to the right of the current pen position when moving to next pinwheel and you can default the side length to any appropraite number.

### Lesson Content
time: 10-15 mins

Teacher - Define and model / live code how to write a for loop. Implement and display outputs.

Teacher - Take an algorithm (to draw a house or any other) and model how you would break it up and implement as a for loop.

Teacher - Take another algo and ask for class chare out how to break up code as a for loop.

---

### Lesson Activity Part 2
time: 15 mins

Students - Take a look at their pinwheel code and they will break up and write a for loop.

---

### Closing
time: 3-5 mins

Option 1 - MC - Which algorithm below using the for loop control structure will correctly output a 5 sided pinwheel?

Option 2(Challenge) - If complete with the question above, Write/Edit the for loop again to be able to draw an octagon/decagon.
