# Topic - Linked List

# Previous knowledge - Lists

# Unplugged Activity 

# Setup 
Rules are: the student has to name or point to the next.
Remind students to remember just those two pieces of data.
Pick one student as the front. To get things started.

Student instructions:
Each student writes two pieces of data
    1 - data (word/number). There own, do not need to share data.
    2 - who the next person is (point to the next student)

Ask another student not in LL to find the data at a specific element/node in the LL. 
Student has to start from the front and can only ask two questions
    1. What's your data?
    2. Who is the next student?
Go from one to the next and have each student pick the next student.

# Concept
    1 - Structure of each node. 
    2 - How to traverse a list only knowing those two pieces of data?
    3 - Try an insert. Try a remove. 

Student Reflections:
    - Do the other students need to know the entire list? Every single piece of data?
    - For insert, do you need to adjust the entire list vs just two nodes only
    - Do remove(pop). As compared to a traditional list, you have to move each element over
    - (optional) Multiple operations on list at same time (as long as different indices)
    - Comparison with List data structure - advantages/disadvantages
    - Have students describe the advantages/disadvantages of LL and Lists.
